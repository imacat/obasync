``obasync`` - Office Basic Macro Source Synchronizer
====================================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

``obasync`` is an OpenOffice/LibreOffice Basic macro source
synchronizer.  It synchronizes your Basic macros with your local
project files.


Given the following source files:

* Directory: ``MyApp``
* Files: ``MyMacros.vb`` ``Utils.vb`` ``Registry.vb`` ``Data.vb``

Running ``obasync`` will synchronize them with the following Basic
macros:

* Library: ``MyApp``
* Modules: ``MyMacros`` ``Utils`` ``Registry`` ``Data``

If the Basic library ``MyApp`` does not exist, it will be created.
Missing modules will be added, and excess modules will be removed.

On the other hand, given the following Basic macros:

* Library: ``MyApp``
* Modules: ``MyMacros`` ``Utils`` ``Registry`` ``Data``

Running ``obasync --get`` will synchronize them with the following
source files:

* Directory: ``MyApp``
* Files: ``MyMacros.vb`` ``Utils.vb`` ``Registry.vb`` ``Data.vb``

Missing source files will be added, and excess source files will be
deleted.


INSTALL
-------

You can either:

1. Install ``obasync`` with ``pip`` (recommended), or

2. Download the ``obasync`` script manually, and run it with the
   Python that come with your OpenOffice/LibreOffice installation.

We will explain them in detail.


OpenOffice/LibreOffice That Comes with Your Linux
#################################################

Install with ``pip`` (Recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your system may already have ``pip`` installed.  If not, install the
``python-pip`` package from the system package manager.  Then, run::

    pip install obasync

Download and Install Manually
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download ``obasync`` from either `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/obasync>`_ or `GitHub
<https://github.com/imacat/obasync>`_.  Then, run ``obasync`` as::

    python obasync

Or, you can edit the script and change the first line (shebang) to::

    #! /usr/bin/python

and save this script somewhere in your path, say, ``/usr/local/bin``.
Then you can run ``obasync``.


OpenOffice 4 on Linux
#####################

Install with ``pip`` (Recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install ``pip`` for your OpenOffice installation, and then install
``obasync`` with this ``pip``::

    wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

LibreOffice on Linux
####################

Python from LibreOffice on Linux does not install ``pip`` properly.
However, you can still download and install ``obasync`` manually.

Install with ``pip`` (Recommended)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download ``obasync`` from either `PyPI
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/obasync>`_ or `GitHub

    /opt/libreoffice5.2/program/python obasync

Or, you can edit the script and change the first line (shebang) to::

    #! /opt/libreoffice5.2/program/python

and save this script somewhere in your path, say, ``/usr/local/bin``.
Then you can run ``obasync``.

OPTIONS
-------

::

  obasync [options] [DIRECTORY [LIBRARY]]

DIRECTORY       The project source directory.  Default to the current
                working directory.

LIBRARY         The name of the Basic library.  Default to the same
                name as the project source directory.

--get           Download (check out) the macros from the
                OpenOffice/LibreOffice Basic storage to the source
                files, instead of upload (check in).  By default it
                uploads the source files onto the
                OpenOffice/LibreOffice Basic storage.

--set-passwd    Sets the password of the library after upload.  Supply
                nothing when prompting the new password to remove the
                password protection.  This does not work with --get.

-p, --port N    The TCP port to communicate with
                OpenOffice/LibreOffice.  The default is 2002.  You can
                change it if port 2002 is already in use.

-x, --ext .EXT  The file name extension of the source files.  The 
                default is ``.vb``.  This may be used for your
                convenience of editor syntax highlighting.

-e, --encoding CS
                The encoding of the source files.  The default is
                system-dependent.  For example, on Traditional Chinese
                MS-Windows, this will be CP950 (Big5).  You can change
                this to UTF-8 for convenience if you
                obtain/synchronize your source code from other
                sources.

-r, --run MODULE.MACRO
                Run he specific macro after synchronization, for
                convenience.

--user          Store the macros in the user macro storage.  (default)

--doc           Store the macros in the document macro storage.

--target TARGET The target storage document if there are more than one
                opened documents.  You may specify a partial path, or
                as "Untitied 1" (in your language) if it is a new
                file.

-h, --help      Show the help message and exit

-v, --version   Show programâ€™s version number and exit
